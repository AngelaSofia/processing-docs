Processing Documentation
==========

This is the official source code for the Processing reference, examples, tutorials, and [processing.org](http://processing.org) web site.

If you have found an error in the Processing reference, examples, tutorials, or website you can file it here under the ["issues" tab](https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/issues).

The [processing](https://github.com/processing/processing) repository contains the source code for Processing itself. (Please use that link to file issues regarding the Processing software.)

### How to build the Javadoc

1) In "build" in the "processing" repo, type "ant doc"
2) Copy the three generated folders to the "processing-javadocs" repo
3) Push changes

<!-- Thanks Ben, Casey, and all the contributors for all things Processing! -->
